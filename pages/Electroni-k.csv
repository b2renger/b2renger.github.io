Paragraph, This project was made for Elektoni-k a french association based in Rennes. They asked me to do a sound postcard from the campus of Rennes 2. I chose to build a web app representing a map of the campus with sound attached to specific location. You can choose to activate the sound and mash them up with a bunch of effects to create new soundscapes., True,
