Paragraph, A flocking algorithm describes the movements of a group of autonomous agents. Daniel Shiffman made a pretty neat implementation of it for processing and p5.js. So I used this base and built a sound engine on top of it using the p5.sound library : each boid becomes a tiny helicopter that you can hear when it's close enough., True,
