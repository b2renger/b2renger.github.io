Paragraph, Equations for organic motion is a codepen.io sketch made by Justin Windle. I added sound to the mix. Since I discovered this link hidden in the code of a project with the mention : this could be interesting here ... I always wondered what it sounds like. Headphones recommended !	,True,

Paragraph, A flocking algorithm describes the movements of a group of autonomous agents. Daniel Shiffman made a pretty neat implementation of it for processing and p5.js. So I used this base and built a sound engine on top of it using the p5.sound library : each boid becomes a tiny helicopter that you can hear when it's close enough., True,

Paragraph, Sid Lee agency installed a bunch arduino based sensors in its parisian office. But they also build a server and an open api to get their data ! So here's a little experimentation with p5.js using their api and the p5.sound lib.,True,

Paragraph, Sadly the project has ended and Sid Lee removed the sensors. The code stays here but it won't do much...,True,
